         </article>         I grew up in Chicago since I was a little kid. I love the city life and I dont see myself anywhere else. Chicago lake front offers great fishing all year round, which can be found in Link 1.  As much as love the city and the beauitful buildings, I enjoy the outdoors and being next to a body of water. 
         Rather its fishing or just walking around, I find myself being free.

                           <article>  As part of growing up Ive spent a lot of my time around my Dad and uncle working around cars. Since then Ive created my life 
                        to be surrended with cars. Rather its fixing, and cleaning my car or hanging out with friends at a car meet. Everyday I learn something new about cars, and found myself in love with the new 2022 M3, which can be found in link 2.
